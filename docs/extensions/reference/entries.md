# Entries, catalogs and tokens

What an extension adds to what a theme is handed, where a game lives somewhere else, and a
name a user may write into a command.

## `ctx.entries`

Something added to every entry a theme is handed. See [Something to an entry](offers.md#something-to-an-entry).

### `ctx.entries.contribute`

`ctx.entries.contribute(key, fetch)`. Required: both.

Answer about one game at a time. `fetch(game)` receives `{game_id, vps_id, name,
manufacturer, year, ipdb_id}`, each the effective value, and returns whatever a theme
should read, or None where there is nothing to say. It is called on core's thread when the
wheel stops, so it may block, and it must not raise for a game it simply has no answer
about.

```python
ctx.entries.contribute("rating", lambda game: {"stars": 4} if game["vps_id"] else None)
```

A theme reads `entry.ext.rating`. Raises `ContractError` for an empty key.

### `ctx.entries.stale`

`ctx.entries.stale(key)`. Required: `key`.

What this extension answered under `key` is out of date: core drops what it holds, and each
game is asked again the next time it is reached. Only the extension that contributes a key
can drop it.

```python
ctx.entries.stale("rating")
```

Does not raise.

## `ctx.catalogs`

Where a game, a table or a file is somewhere else. See [An outside link](offers.md#an-outside-link).

### `ctx.catalogs.contribute`

`ctx.catalogs.contribute(key, name, subject, link)`. Required: all four.

`subject` is `game`, `table` or `file`. `link(item)` receives a plain description of one
and returns its address there, or `""`.

```python
ctx.catalogs.contribute("scores", "Example Scores", "game",
                        lambda game: f"https://scores.example.com/t/{game['vps_id']}")
```

The user sees a row named `name` with an open-in-new icon. A `link` that raises, or
answers anything but an http or https address, is left out. Raises `ContractError` for any
other `subject`.

## `ctx.tokens`

A name a user may write into a command. See [A name a command can use](offers.md#a-name-a-command-can-use).

### `ctx.tokens.VPINFE`

The string `"vpinfe"`: the context of the pair of commands around VPinFE itself.

```python
ctx.tokens.offer("season", (ctx.tokens.VPINFE, ctx.tokens.TABLE), lambda values: "spring")
```

### `ctx.tokens.TABLE`

The string `"table"`: the context of the pair of commands around every table.

```python
ctx.tokens.offer("season", (ctx.tokens.TABLE,), lambda values: "spring")
```

### `ctx.tokens.offer`

`ctx.tokens.offer(name, contexts, value, *, says="", after_only=False) -> str`.
Required: `name`, `contexts`, `value`.

Offer `{<extension>.<name>}`. Answers the full name, which is what a user types. `value(values)`
receives what the command context has resolved so far and answers a string; empty is an
answer.

```python
full = ctx.tokens.offer("season", (ctx.tokens.TABLE,), lambda values: "spring")
# full == "example_scores.season"
```

The user sees it in the list of names a command may use, with what it stands for. Raises
`ContractError` for a name with nothing saying what it stands for (`says`, or
`token.<name>.says` in the catalog), an unknown context, or a name already taken.
