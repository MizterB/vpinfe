"""What an upgrade of the program leaves in its settings file.

A plugin that was renamed or dropped takes its keys with it, and nothing upstream carries
the values across. A key counts as left behind only while the program has the plugin that
replaced it and lacks the one that wrote it, so a program whose plugins cannot be read
leaves nothing behind. A key whose replacement already holds a value is not offered: the
value somebody set there is the one in force.
