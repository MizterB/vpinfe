"""Binds the lifecycle vocabulary to the things that actually start and stop.

Every stop and restart of this process ends the same way: `run_frontend_loop` returns and
`main.py` runs `shutdown_services`. Reaching for the browser directly skips it, so those
performers only ever make that loop return.

Two stops are the exception and leave the loop alone. Stopping the frontend closes its
windows and VPinFE keeps running; starting or restarting it opens them again. Stopping a
table is the other: the table is a child of this install rather than a part of it, and
closing one leaves VPinFE and its windows up.
