"""Putting the controller's buttons in front of a Manager on another device.

A browser reads a gamepad only on its own device, so a Manager opened elsewhere cannot hear
this one's. While one is listening, the window that is the controller reports each button
it sees and `common.events` carries it back, so the Manager page hears it as if it had
been pressed there.

Registered once per process against the shared bridge, like `input_events`. The message
goes to every window and the controller one answers: which window that is, is browser-side
knowledge.
