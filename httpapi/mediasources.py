"""The online sources, and what the catalogs among them have for a game.

A source declares what it can serve and answers what it holds for one game; this reports
all of them together, the ones that ship and the ones extensions contribute, so a client
picks a picture rather than picking a website.

Which sources are asked is a setting. Which exist is not - a source is always listed, so
an install that turned one off can see that it did.
