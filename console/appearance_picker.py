"""Picking the Console's appearance by looking at it.

A select would put four words on screen, and the words are the weakest part of this
decision - "Synthwave" means nothing until you have seen it, and Dark and Light are
two words for something the eye settles in about a tenth of a second. So each mode
draws itself: a miniature of this surface in that mode's own colors.

The values are expanded rather than referenced. Every swatch is painted on a page that
is already in one of these modes, so a `var()` left in place would resolve against the
palette in use and all four would come out the same.
