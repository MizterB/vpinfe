"""The DMD panel switch: an LED panel on the cabinet in place of a screen.

The switch is `real_dmd.enabled`. The kind is asked once it is on, because Visual Pinball
shows nothing on a panel until its DMDUtil plugin is told which kind to look for, and
`follow` carries the answer there. Turning the switch off writes VPinFE's setting only.
