"""Manufacturer logos: media keyed by a game's manufacturer, not by the game or a theme.

A logo belongs to hundreds of tables and outlives any one theme, so it lives in a folder
of its own - `media.manufacturer_logos_dir`, defaulting to manufacturer_logos/ under the
config dir - served at /manufacturers/<slug>/logo. The folder is flat: image files named
for the manufacturer. Nothing ships in the tree.

A file and a manufacturer meet at a slug of the name with case, punctuation and corporate
suffixes dropped, so "Williams Electronics.PNG", "williams.png" and a table whose
manufacturer is "Williams" all find each other. Slugs are compared with their hyphens
removed as well, so "Game Plan" finds GamePlan.png. The exceptions no rule can cover
("D. Gottlieb & Co.") belong in an alias map beside the images: manufacturers.json,
{"name or slug": "canonical-slug"}. One alias ships in the code, Taito do Brasil to Taito;
a logo of the name's own comes before it, and a name in manufacturers.json overrides it.
