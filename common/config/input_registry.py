"""Every input action VPinFE understands, declared once.

Eleven actions, each with one ordered list of bindings. The names say what the player
*meant* rather than which way a stick moved: three surfaces - the wheel, a vertical menu
and a scrolling page - already disagreed about what "left" pointed at, and every overlay
carried a fall-through case as the evidence.

A binding names its own input - `key:<name>`, `pad:<index>/button:<n>` - so an action
needs one list rather than a key per input. Richer selectors - modifiers, axes, hold,
chord - go in this same list, so adding them is a parser change rather than another
migration.

An input has one press and one hold, so `key:Escape` and `key:Escape@hold:1500` share a
key without clashing, and two holds on one key do clash whatever their lengths.
`pad:standard/button:<n>` is the standard layout's button n, for a pad the browser reports
as standard only; the numbered form is for any pad.
