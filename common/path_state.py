"""What the disk says about a path, asked one way for everything that names one.

A setting's executable, a library folder, a folder somebody added to import from: each is
a path that is perfectly well-formed and may still be gone, on a share that is not mounted,
on a drive that went read-only, or on a server that is not answering. Each asks the same
question, so each gets the same answers in the same words.

Asked of the disk when somebody looks and never stored. A stored answer is wrong the
moment a mount drops, and a mount dropping is the ordinary case this exists to report.

Answered on the machine the path belongs to. One install cannot stat another's disk.
