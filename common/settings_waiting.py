"""What has been changed and is not yet in effect.

A setting is read by something at a particular moment - as it is used, when the windows
open, when VPinFE starts - and `ConfigOption.applies` says which. This remembers what
each of the last two was read as, and answers which settings now differ from that.

Changing a value back clears it, because the answer is a comparison and not a list of
edits. Window settings wait for a reopen, or for a restart when the set of windows has
changed: a window's API is built once at startup, so a reopen cannot add or remove one.
An install with no windows open has nothing for a window setting to wait on.
