"""What an upgrade of a launcher's program left in its settings, and moving it.

The app says what was left (`left_behind`) and what each setting becomes. This turns that
into the notice's rows, writes the settings that move, and puts a box the settings held into
each backglass file that has none. Everything it writes is journaled so one call undoes it.

A box is carried only where the file places no DMD of its own for that window: what a file
already says is the one in force. A box any of whose files cannot be written stays where it
is, whole, and is named under `held_back`; none of its files is written. So is a box that
would take the move past the files the undo journal keeps, and every box after it, so that
Undo can always put back everything a move wrote. Everything that can refuse does so before
anything is written, the files go first and the settings last, and a settings write that
fails puts the files back.
