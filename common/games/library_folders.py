"""Where this install looks for entries.

A location is either a **root**, whose children are game folders, or a **single game
folder**. Both kinds coexist in one list, so a library can be a share plus the two
folders somebody keeps elsewhere without either being second class.

The list is `locations` in `vpinfe.json`, and which one new entries are created in is
`updates.new_games_location`. **Per install, not per library** - a path is a fact about
one machine, and a share reachable from the cabinet may not be reachable from the laptop
reading the same library. The share a folder was last seen on is not a setting, so it is
kept on this install's row of the device registry, where a config file carried to another
machine does not take it along.

Whether a location is reachable and whether it can be written to are asked of the disk
when somebody looks, never stored. A stored answer is wrong the moment a mount drops,
and a mount dropping is the ordinary case this exists to report well.
