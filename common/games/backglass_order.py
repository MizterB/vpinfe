"""The order a table's backglass and score display draw in, kept to what its backglass file
places.

Every table gets a live DMD from the launcher's order. A table whose file places a Score
View DMD is given an order of its own in its settings so that file's art shows with the DMD
on it. The app says what to hold (`launcher_ops.backglass_order`) and this writes it, from
the state the file and the settings are in, so running it again changes nothing. What was
written is recorded (`order_record`), and only a pair still equal to its record is changed
or taken out.
