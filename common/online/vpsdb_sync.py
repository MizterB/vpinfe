"""Keeping the local VPSdb copy current, and knowing when it is due.

Everything that reads the catalog reads a file: matching, the release list, what a kind
is offered from, whether a link is a download. `load_vpsdb` opens `vpsdb.json` and
returns it, so all of those are exactly as fresh as the last download.

The check is cheap and the download is not: `lastUpdate.json` is one line, and the
catalog is about 7 MB. So the schedule governs how often the *question* is asked; the
answer only costs bandwidth when it has changed.
