"""What a person has said about a VPS entry or release: Wanted, or Ignored.

One store for both, so a thing is unmarked, Wanted or Ignored and never two. Kept in
STATE_DIR: a mark is what only a person can say, and clearing the cache must not lose it.

A mark names its thing by scope, VPS id and detail:

| scope     | id             | detail           | can be   |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| `game`    | the entry      |                  | both     |
| `release` | the release    |                  | both     |
| `gap`     | the entry      | the Home tab     | ignored  |
| `updates` | the release    |                  | ignored  |
| `version` | the release    | the version      | ignored  |

A gap's detail is the key of the Home tab it is ignored from: the VPS kind for a tab VPS
lists (`b2sFiles`), the media kind for a tab only a source fills. `updates` and `version`
are stored, and nothing reads them yet.

Setting a state on a thing that holds the other replaces it. Nothing here reads the
catalog: whether an id still exists is for the caller, and a mark for an id VPS drops is
simply never drawn.
