"""Discovery's front page, answered in one read: what VPS added lately, whose work the
library holds, which of its games lack a kind VPS lists, and which games VPS lists that it
has none of, which of those share a title with a game it holds, which games of the
library need a look, and which games a release page was opened for.

Drawn from the answer `library_vps_state.discovery` gives, so Home and the grid never
disagree about what is held. The VPS side is stored state; the media gaps a source can fill
come from the sources' index, which the caller reads.

    """Every shelf. `found` is `library_vps_state.discovery`'s answer, `kept` the VPS kinds
    the library collects, and `days` the window of the New shelf. `media` is the games a
    source can fill a slot of, by media kind, as `media_fill.offered_listing` answers. A kind
    VPS lists too (`MEDIA_OF`) is one tab with it, a game once; the other media kinds follow
    the VPS kinds, one tab each. Every game a source can fill is listed, none cut to a row.
    `holders` is the library's game ids by entry; with it a game VPS lists is one record for each
    game matched to the entry, so a tab counts games and `game_ids` names them all.

    New is cut to what a tile row shows, once for each chip, with the count each chip holds
    so a chip with nothing in it is left out by the page. Whatever `marks` ignores is on no
    shelf, and what it holds Wanted is its own. `dont_have` is the games the library lacks, cut
    to a row of tiles with the count of all of them, counting the tables in `formats`. `family` is
    the part of those that share a title with a game the library holds. `library` is the
    library's games as `library_ops.library_games` answers, which `health` reads. `opened` is
    the journal of release pages opened, and the shelf lists every game of it the library
    still lacks.
    `updates` is what `library_updates.found` answers: the games with a later version of
    something they hold. `unmatched_games` is the library's games with no VPS match, for
    the shelf that names the entry each is likely to be."""
