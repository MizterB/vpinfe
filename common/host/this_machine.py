"""Whether a request is this machine's own, judged from the socket and the browser's headers.

Trust that needs no credential takes four things together: the peer is this machine, nothing
on the way in says it was forwarded, the request asked for a name this machine answers to,
and a browser that sent it did so from a page of VPinFE's own. A page on another site fails
the last, a DNS-rebound name fails the third, and a proxy fails the second.

Judged from the socket's address and the request's Host, Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site, never
from a forwarding header: those are written by the caller.
