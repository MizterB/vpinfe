"""Whether a port setting can be bound, asked when it is saved.

A port is read once, by the server that binds it, so a bad one is found at the next start
- by an install that does not come back. Answered on the machine the setting belongs to:
what is listening is a fact about that machine, so a caller names a setting and the install
holding it answers.
