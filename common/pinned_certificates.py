"""The certificate another install showed when this one was paired with it.

Two installs on a home network usually have no certificate authority between them: the
other one serves HTTPS from a certificate it signed itself, which a browser-style check
refuses. So pairing takes the certificate the other install shows at that moment, keeps its
SHA-256 fingerprint beside the secrets, and every later call to that address and port must
meet the same certificate. One that differs raises `CertificateChangedError` and nothing is
sent; pairing again is the only way to trust the new one.

A certificate a certificate authority vouches for for the name dialled is not pinned at all,
so a renewal never reads as a change. Taking the fingerprint the first time is trust on
first use: it protects every call after pairing and gives nothing against a machine in the
middle of the pairing itself.
