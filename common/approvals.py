"""Asking first: a program asks to make one Protected change, and the Owner decides.

The program names the exact request - method, path and body - and waits. Approving it lets
that one request through, once, and only if it is repeated by the same token with the same
method, path and body. Nothing is stored for the program to replay: the request itself is
never held, only its description, and a restart forgets every ask.

Nothing here knows about HTTP. `httpapi/approvals.py` carries the routes and
`httpapi/auth.py` redeems an approval on the request that presents it.
