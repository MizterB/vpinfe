"""Pictures an extension's rows name, kept and served by core.

A row holds a web address or a file in the extension's folder. The page is never given
either: `address` turns it into one of core's own, and `served` answers it, so a third
party never learns who is looking at the Manager or when. Only a source that came in
this extension's own rows has an address, so the route fetches nothing else.
