"""What an extension declares, and what it is handed.

An extension is a directory holding `extension.json` beside a Python package whose
`register(ctx)` core calls once at startup. The context is the whole of its reach into
VPinFE - it never receives the application, and that is the guarantee the model rests on.

An implementation imports this module for the types and nothing else of ours.
