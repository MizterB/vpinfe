"""The accepted list in a test: one of its own, and an Owner who presses Accept.

Extensions and themes VPinFE did not ship stay stopped until accepted, so a test about what
an extension does once it runs has to accept it first. `owner_accepts` does that the way
the Owner does, through `accepted.accept_extension`, for each extension a registry is about
to load. A test about the gate itself uses `isolated` and leaves the accepting to itself.
