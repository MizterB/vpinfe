"""A fixture extension whose Community lists derive tags and rank, and nothing real behind
them.

Kept in its own root so the suites that load every extension under `fixtures/extensions`
do not grow lists they never asked for. Its settings say which ids each list holds,
comma-separated, and whether a read fails, so a test sets up the week it wants. The two
ranked lists hold `id=rating` pairs, a rating left empty for one nobody rated.

The Ratings list also says how it stands: `status` is its line and `status_to` where the
line sends somebody, and while `waiting` holds anything its menu offers Post Now before a
link to the week. Posting empties `waiting`. The labels of those two acts are in the
fixture's own `i18n/en.json`.
