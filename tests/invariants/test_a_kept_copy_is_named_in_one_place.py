"""The name of a kept copy is built by `common/games/info_migration.py`, and read there.

`backup_path` makes one, `is_copy`, `copied_from`, `backup_stamp` and `backup_reason` take one
apart. A second place that spells the marker writes names the first cannot read back, and
the listing in `common/backups/` would not show them.

`apps/vpx/config.py` is the one other spelling, because an app may not import `common/games`.
Its marker has to stay equal to the real one.
