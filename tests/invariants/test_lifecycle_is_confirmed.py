"""Nothing we ship asks the backend to quit or power off behind the confirm.

The confirmation is drawn in the browser, because the bridge to a window only goes one
way and the backend cannot raise a dialog. So `requestLifecycle` is where the question
gets asked, and `close_app` / `shutdown_system` - the 2.x spellings, kept so an old theme
keeps working - go straight past it.

The main menu used those, which is the one surface on a cabinet that can shut the machine
down. Confirm Before Exit did nothing from it, and the setting looked broken rather than
bypassed.
