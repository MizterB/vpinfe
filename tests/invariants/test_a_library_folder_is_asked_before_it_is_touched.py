"""A function that walks the library folders asks `path_state` about them before it touches
one. A stat on a share that has gone never returns and cannot be cancelled, so the question
has to be one that carries its own time limit. A function that asks about one path and
touches another passes: this reads which calls a function makes, not what they are given."""
