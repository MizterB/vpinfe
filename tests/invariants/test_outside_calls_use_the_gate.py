"""A call to another machine goes through `http_client`, or asks it first.

The gate is where VPINFE_OFFLINE refuses a host outside this machine, where a host that
said wait is left alone, and where a timeout is always set. A call that goes around it
does none of the three, so the suite can reach the network and an offline machine waits
out a timeout for every one.
