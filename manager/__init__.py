"""The web surfaces an install serves: the Manager at / and /manager, the remote at
/remote.

What the Manager contains depends on the install - one curating a library and one
running games do not need the same screens. The remote is the same install seen from a
phone, and it is a second shell rather than the same one narrowed: a workbench is a list
beside an inspector, and one hand cannot hold two panes.
