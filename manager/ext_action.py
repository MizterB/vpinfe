"""What core draws when somebody presses an action an extension offers.

The extension describes what to ask and what to call; this binds its four calls -
`POST {base}/ask`, `POST {base}/check`, `POST {base}/act` and `POST {base}/run`, and
`GET {base}/progress` while one of them is slow - and hands
them to the shared wizard control (`manager/kit/wizard.py`), which does the drawing.
Nothing about the treatment comes from the extension, so every action looks like the
Manager rather than like whoever wrote it, and it keeps working if that extension later
runs somewhere else.
