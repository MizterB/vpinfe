"""Pictures from a source on Discovery: taking one for a game that has none, and setting aside
one that would replace what the game has.

A game on Home that lacks a picture a source has is taken from its tile. A picture that
replaced one VPinFE placed shows beside the game's own in the pane, where it is taken like any
other and can be set aside: Keep Mine for this version of it, Ignore Updates for the picture.
