"""Hearing the buttons and keys VPinFE runs with from a Manager opened on another device.

The browser reads a gamepad and a keyboard only on its own device, so a binding table
opened elsewhere cannot hear the ones VPinFE runs with. While the page's switch is on it
asks, over `common.events`, for the frontend's controller window to report them, and passes
each one to the page's own listener. The Manager does not import the frontend: the bus is
the only thing between them.

A page holds the buttons from the moment it arms until it disarms, is taken from, or goes
away. The frontend names the newest holder at the cabinet.
