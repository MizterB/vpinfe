"""The power icon at the foot of the rail: this install's own device menu, from every page.

The verbs are the ones the Devices page draws for this device. Restart and the window
reopen go through the waiting line, so they follow the Manager to a new port, and lead the
menu with how much is waiting once the line has been dismissed. On an install that owns
windows the menu also follows them: Close and Reopen while they are up, Open while they
are not. The dot is up only while changes wait, and the hover then says how many.

A browser another device signed in ends its own sign-in from the foot of the menu, which is
the one entry about the person and not the device.
